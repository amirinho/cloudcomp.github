<p><b>1.	More speed and performance</b></br>
If your services and applications are suffering due to the increase in traffic they receive daily and it is increasingly difficult for you to scale resources to meet the demand, migrating your applications to the cloud can rid you of all these concerns.
Your customers will be satisfied with the rapid deployment and implementation of the applications. Nowadays, cloud services are designed to place servers with resources on demand that adapt to your needs immediately without investing in expensive infrastructure.
</br></br><b>2.	Security without a complicated infrastructure</b></br>
Forget breaking your head thinking about the complex infrastructure that you have to deploy to provide the services you need.
The services in the cloud usually do this work for you, in addition, they are in charge of monitoring potential failures in the applications and possible interruptions in the operation of the virtual machines.
No doubt this will save you a lot of time and money since you will not have to put your IT team to work on periodic maintenance, system upgrades, etc.
Many cloud computing models take over the administrative work that requires the maintenance of your apps and data in the cloud.
</br></br><b>3.	Save more with auto scaling</b></br>
Data migration to the cloud also has economic benefits thanks to autoscaling. Some providers offer this option to their clients and the user can increase the number of services they need at any time.
However, you can switch them off when you do not need them. This means that you will be only charged for the time you actually use the additional services. This way, you will not have to keep additional machines running continuously to cope with sudden traffic spikes.
</br></br><b>4.	Data backup all the time</b></br>
When you do data migration to the cloud, you have the possibility of getting monitoring services, backups, and logging services. This is extremely important in case you need to perform a disaster recovery.
Thanks to the backups in the cloud, you will be able to put your system and your data back into operation almost immediately and you will be able to know in depth what caused the failure.
Cloud providers can also save you a few headaches by taking care of security issues such as keeping unwanted traffic out of the machines where your data and apps are stored and keeping up to date with the latest system security updates so you do not have to worry about the latest threats.
However, this does not guarantee the security of your data, since you must also take the necessary precautions regarding the staff of your company with permission to access your data.
</br></br><b>5.	Data migration provides flexibility to work</b></br>
When doing data migration to the cloud, your IT team will no longer have to worry about being in one place to deploy, update services or fix problems regarding the virtual machines.
Thanks to the consistency of processes and executions facilitated by the cloud, the collaboration of your team will be better without the need for shadow IT.
