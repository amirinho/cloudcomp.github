<p><h3>The issues of data migration in cloud computing</h3>

</br><b>Financial expenses</b></br>
-Even though cloud migration is very profitable in the future as it increases efficiency, and lowers admin costs, it is a very expensive journey.

Training the employees to be able to easily make use of the new system is quite costly. 

</br><b></br>Some of the costs includes but are not limited to:</b></br>
-Reconstruction of application architecture for the cloud
-Spending money for people and the technology that is needed to migrate successfully
-The costs of bandwidth 

</br><b></br>Resistance to change</b></br>
Since cloud migration brings a lot of changes to how the company carries out its tasks, many employees will resist to adapt to the new system.

</br><b></br>Shortage of skills</b></br>
It is difficult to find the right people who have adequate skills to be able to manage a good migration. Because many companies are trying to move their data to the cloud, the demand for migration experts is very high and the supply for these experts is very low.
