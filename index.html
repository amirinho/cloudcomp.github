<h3>Data storage in cloud computing  </h3>
 <p>
Data storage in cloud is a space offered by cloud vendors specifically dedicated to allows clients store their data on an off-site storage system for a nominal fee. </br></br>
<h4>Some features of cloud storage are:</h4> </br>
Automatic backups-</br> </br>
Remote access-  </br></br>
File sharing - </br></br>
File security- </br></br>
<h4>Cloud storage requirements</h4>
Durability: Hosting vendors should ensure data redundancy, data should be stored across multiple systems to achieve redundancy, storage system breakdown shouldn't result to permanent data loss. 

</br></br>Availability: cloud vendors should ensure data is available on network at all times. </br></br>
 security: Cloud vendors should ensure all data are encrypted, permission and access control should be paramount. 
 </p></br>
<h3>How it works </h3>
At its most fundamental level cloud storage system requires one data server connected to the internet, 
Clients then subscribed into the cloud storage service and transmit their data from local storage system to the data server across the network. 
client accesses the data server for purposes of managing, uploading and retrieving their content through a web based interface made available by the hosting company. 
Storage hardware’s that physically store client’s data are housed and managed in a cloud vendor data center. Cloud storage vendors ensures security for physical environment where storage hardware’s are kept and clients data is available and accessible through a web service Api or web-based content management systems at all times. 
clients can access, upload their data, manage and retrieve it through these interfaces.
 clients can also sync their data across various devices for easy access. </br>
 </br>
   
 
<h3>life cycle of a data in a cloud environment  </h3>
 
<b>Data creation stage</b>-when a data is produced certain amount of additional copies of cloud data is being created according to the specific security requirements of each data and the storage policy, all the copies are transferred across storage devices in a shared way. 
</br></br><b>Data maintenance stage</b>- Data are processed within applications to achieve various objectives. However, data are simply stored in storage devices waiting for later usage. Certain mechanisms are put in place to safeguard data quality. 
 </br></br>
 
<b>Data recovery stage</b>- Data copies could be lost at the data maintenance stage due to hardware breakdowns, so to prevent total loss of data, Data recovery is required. At this stage specific mechanisms are being deployed to recover the lost copies, the recovery protocols of these mechanisms differ so the duration of data recovery can vary. 
 </br></br>
<b>Data deletion stage</b>- Data is being deleted when it's no longer needed, the storage space restoration mechanism of the cloud is responsible for recycling the pre-occupied storage space when a data lifecycle ends.
