<p><h3>The process of data migration in Cloud Computing</h3></br></br>

<b>-The clients have to make sure that their strategies and business cases are properly defined. They need to be fully aware about the business value that they will gain by moving to the cloud.</b></br></br></br>

It is vital for individuals to be crystal clear about the specific objectives which they want to achieve by moving to the cloud.

After clearly stating their objectives, the individuals can start to develop a cloud migration strategy and the business case which will clearly outline how the move will be carried out. They need to determine which applications that they are willing to migrate to the cloud, they should also determine the infrastructure that they will use as well as the cloud environment

</br></br><b></br>-The clients need to be clear about what they want to move, where exactly to move it and when to move it. </b></br></br></br>

It is crucial for individuals to properly manage risks. They need to be aware of all of the policies of the service provider as well as knowing how their applications will perform when there are any infrastructure changes .

Companies and individuals need to know and understand their existing infrastructure, data landscape and application so that they can be clear about the most appropriate applications and data to move to the cloud.

With the help of dependency mapping, application discovery and risk assessments which are heavily based on current usage and pre-migration predictive analysis, the Migration Assessment to the cloud makes it possible for migration planners to be able to make good decisions, this helps the individuals to reduce risk while ensuring service level agreements are well-maintained after cloud migration 

</br></br><b></br>-Moving things the to the cloud (Cloud migration)</b></br></br></br>

This will involve making existing applications modernized for the cloud, developing new applications which are cloud-native, and the transformation of the infrastructure and architecture. The final objective: building a new technology operating model and culture that allows the companies and individuals to innovate at a fast pace in an effective and efficient manner. 

It is crucial for individuals and companies to utilize automated management and migration tools since they allow them to execute a smooth and easy migration. They allow the movement to be faster and they attain repeatability and consistency as well as delivering high quality. Once these tools are collaborated with specialized skills and solution accelerators, they can even smoothen the transition process more. It is also critical for the individuals to have a cloud journey management plan to be able to keep track of the effort
